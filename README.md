# buy-price

**Usage**
`npm start -- FB`

This program will evaluate the fair-price of a stock using the discounted cash flow method.
It will output the result into a fix folder:
`C:\Users\Mike\OneDrive - Digital Sparcs\Investing\Value Investing Process\Business analysis/{stock}`

The output file is named fair-value-{execution date}.json

The program relies on core-data being created for the stock before hand. See [core-data](https://github.com/mcoxeter/core-data)
